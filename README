ABOUT THIS SCRIPT
=================

This bash script was designed to automate and simplify the remote backup
process of duplicity on Amazon S3.  After your script is configured, you can
easily backup, restore, verify and clean (either via cron or manually) your
data without having to remember lots of different command options and
passphrases.

Most importantly, you can easily backup the script and your gpg key in a
convenient passphrase-encrypted file.  This comes in in handy if/when your
machine ever does go belly up.

Optionally, you can set up an email address where the log file will be sent.
Useful when the script is used via cron.

BEFORE YOU START
================

This script requires user configuration.  Instructions are in
the file itself and should be self-explanatory.  Be sure to replace all the
*foobar* values with your real ones.  Almost every value needs to be
configured in someway.

You can use multiple copies of the script with different settings for different
backup scenarios.  It is designed to run as a cron job and will log information
to a text file (including remote file sizes, if you have s3cmd installed).  Be
sure to make the script executable (chmod +x) before you hit the gas.
